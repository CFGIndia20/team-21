# 21 SMART

## Overview
This project contains Android for  mobile and PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, CSS for mobile. The android files are in the android folder and SQL file is in the SQL folder. The web files are around them :smiley:.
<br>
The app communicates with the server using API endpoints created using PHP scripts. The app sends and receives both images and text with the server.
<br>

## Main Features
1. Uploading of work(Images, text) by the beneficiaries. 
2. Assessment of work by volunteer(Posting pictures by the woman to prevent major mishap).
3. Log in and Sign up features for the beneficiaries.
4. Summarized reports for admin(No of women helped, credits paid to beneficiaries etc) thus enabling decision making.
5. Minimalistic UI that can be used by a person from any background.

## Future plans
1. Additional reports for admin(Communities reached)
2. Multilingual android app(so that we can have even better reach)
3. Calculate compensation for beneficiaries(because incentives matter!)
